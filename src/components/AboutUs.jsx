              I am a front-end developer based in Sydney looking for exciting
              opportunities. Has Mechanical Engineering background. Likes to
              focus on accessibility when developing. Passionate and curious
              about solving problems. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Reactjs, Webflow
              and a bit of Designing. While I am not programming, I enjoy
              playing football, photography and playing Valorant. Learning more
              to improve skill.
